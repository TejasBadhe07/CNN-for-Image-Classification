# CNN-for-Image-Classification-
I'm using AlexNet Network for image classification 
The architecture consists of eight layers: five convolutional layers and three fully-connected layers.

AlexNet is an incredibly powerful model capable of achieving high accuracies on very challenging datasets. However, removing any of the convolutional layers will drastically degrade AlexNetâ€™s performance. AlexNet is a leading architecture for any object-detection task and may have huge applications in the computer vision sector of artificial intelligence problems. In the future, AlexNet may be adopted more than CNNs for image tasks.


As a milestone in making deep learning more widely-applicable, AlexNet can also be credited with bringing deep learning to adjacent fields such as natural language processing and medical image analysis.
